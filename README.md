CS70 moment.\
Hello, I am Brandon, the author of this lecture note series. Here are my notes about how you should treat my notes, for people to learn CS70 properly if they upon unfortunate transpirations had to read my notes, and for this series of notes to remain helpful.

## Any Advices on CS70?
For some reason, I was patient enough to organize my thoughts right when I completed CS70.\
You may find my story at this link: https://medium.com/@bransthre/course-review-compsci-70-894ebc71991e

This Medium post involves my summary towards what CS70 taught me.
I was not able to concretely confirm my earnings in treating CS70 seriously until when I took on harder assignments in EECS 127 and COMPSCI 189 right at the next semester, where I directly benefited by treating studying CS70 and seriously exploring where do other people's mathematical intuition originate, and how I may replicate their success and find my source of mathematical intuition.

As for whether CS70 has remarkable practicality in my life outside Computer Science, yes. I am now able to precisely compute how much gems I should store in gacha games for a safe probability of getting in-game achievements, based on my studies in concentration inequality and probabilistic proofs.

## First of all, My Notes are Not Substitutes to the Course Readers
My notes are my own transcriptions for CS70 lecture notes.
On a professional note, yes, you may use these for personal purposes and gaining extra insights on in-course contexts, but this is by no means a pedagogical substitute of the original course notes, even if it describes all the concepts of CS70 lecture notes.

On a professional note, once again, the CS70 official course notes are structured in a pedagogical imperative: it connects concepts to optimize student understanding and the coherency of course content (even if it might have been confusing on the first reads).
This course note does not. I was not obligated to connect concepts. I was only writing the work to organize information for my own sake. This work is not specifically written for the public just like my CSM resources were.
**My notes is by no means a substitute of CS70.**

But, thinking from the other angle, we may consider these notes I produced as a complementary resource for CS70.

## How did Brandon Use This Note?
Great Question. I'm glad you asked. Cyrus.

During my CS70 phase, I used this note extensively to lookup summaries of concepts when writing homeworks and mock exams, as well as to force myself to read through derivations on lecture notes via transcribing them onto LaTeX and running a rigorous revision later.
Therefore, you may see that my notes are not written very formally or professionally. (In fact, none of my work might have ever been considered fully professional up until perhaps five years later.)
The informality shows I am using this notes as a casual summary of my learnings.

I have also shared my notes to others (as you see, it is hosted as an open source project on Github), in the hope that they can use these notes as a lookup for summaries.

## What is Your Favorite Flavor of Ice Cream?
Ice Cream.

## Did you enjoy CS70?
Unfortunately, yes, and your next line is, "What a nerd".\
First of all, I must strictly inform you for the explicit comment you just made: Yeah, you're not wrong.

The reason I started enjoying CS70 is because I have a friend who I study CS70 with during and after discussion sections. This friend is very high-achieving, and I enjoyed having competitions with him even if I lose everytime.\
This is because I have been able to observe and learn a lot about his thinking pattern, everytime we revise our works after competing on mock exams.\
In summary, I enjoyed the process of competing with people and learning how they compete, as well as the stories that led them to the worthy competitors they are now.
